# EIPAS - Enterprise Idea-to-Product Automation System

A Python implementation of an intelligent workflow automation system that transforms innovative ideas into production-ready systems through AI-powered analysis and validation.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install
```bash
# Download the script
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/eipas/main/eipas.py
# Or just copy the eipas.py file to your system
```

### 2. Initialize
```bash
python eipas.py init
```

### 3. Run Your First Workflow
```bash
python eipas.py run "AI-powered customer service chatbot with sentiment analysis"
```

### 4. Check Status
```bash
python eipas.py status
```

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `init` | Initialize EIPAS system | `python eipas.py init` |
| `run` | Process an idea through workflow | `python eipas.py run "Your idea"` |
| `status` | Show workflow status | `python eipas.py status` |
| `health` | System health check | `python eipas.py health` |

## 🏗️ System Architecture

EIPAS processes ideas through 5 phases:

1. **Phase 1: CXO Evaluation** (9 executives)
   - CEO, CTO, CFO, COO, CMO, CHRO, CPO, CSO, CIO
   - Quality Gate: ≥95% feasibility score

2. **Phase 2: Business Analysis** (4 analysts)
   - Business Analyst, Market Researcher, Financial Analyst, Risk Analyst
   - Quality Gate: ≥90% viability score

3. **Phase 3: Product & Architecture** (5 specialists)
   - Product Manager, UX Designer, Product Owner, Solution Architect, Data Architect
   - Quality Gate: ≥95% alignment score

4. **Phase 4: Implementation** (4 developers)
   - Database Developer, Backend Developer, Frontend Developer, Integration Developer
   - Quality Gate: ≥95% completeness score

5. **Phase 5: Quality Assurance** (4 specialists)
   - Unit Test, Integration Test, E2E Test, Performance Test Specialists
   - Quality Gate: ≥95% quality score

## 📁 Directory Structure

After initialization, EIPAS creates:

```
~/.claude/eipas-system/
├── config/
│   └── eipas-config.json
├── agent-prompts/
│   ├── cxo-executives/
│   ├── business-analysts/
│   ├── product-specialists/
│   ├── architecture-specialists/
│   ├── development-specialists/
│   └── qa-specialists/
└── workspace/
    └── eipas-[timestamp]-[idea-slug]/
        ├── idea.json
        ├── phase1/
        ├── phase2/
        └── ...
```

## 🎯 Quality Gates

Each phase must meet quality thresholds:

- **Phase 1**: ≥95% CXO feasibility (CRITICAL)
- **Phase 2**: ≥90% business viability
- **Phase 3**: ≥95% product-architecture alignment
- **Phase 4**: ≥95% implementation completeness
- **Phase 5**: ≥95% system quality (CRITICAL)

## 📊 Example Output

```bash
$ python eipas.py run "AI-powered inventory management system"

## 🔧 Configuration

The system configuration is stored in `~/.claude/eipas-system/config/eipas-config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "quality_gates": {
    "phase1_feasibility": 95,
    "phase2_viability": 90,
    "phase3_alignment": 95,
    "phase4_completeness": 95,
    "phase5_quality": 95
  }
}
```

## 🎭 Current Implementation Note

This is a **simulation version** - the agents currently generate simulated analysis. To connect with actual AI agents:

1. Replace the `_simulate_agent()` method with Claude API calls
2. Add actual agent prompts to the `agent-prompts/` directories
3. Implement real intelligence integration between agents

## 🤝 Contributing

This is the foundation for a more complete system. Areas for enhancement:

- Claude API integration
- Real agent prompt execution
- Cross-agent intelligence sharing
- Web interface
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Integration with development tools
